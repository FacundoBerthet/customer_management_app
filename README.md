## Quick Demo

You can try the app online without installing anything:

1. **Start the backend:**
  - Go to https://customer-management-app-morg.onrender.com/ to wake up the backend.
  - Wait for the loading screen to finish (the backend may take up to 1 minute to wake up if it was sleeping).
2. **Open the frontend:**
  - Go to https://facundoberthet.github.io/customer_management_app/
  - Use the app normally. All features are available.

**Tip:** If the backend was sleeping, you may get errors in the frontend until it wakes up. Always open the backend link first and wait for the loading screen to finish before using the frontend.

```

## Dev (without Docker)

Requirements: Java 17, Node.js, and a local PostgreSQL server.

1) Backend

- Create the database (example: `customerdb`).
- Run the API:

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

App (Vite dev): http://localhost:5173
