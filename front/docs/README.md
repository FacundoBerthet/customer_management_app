# Frontend Docs

Detailed documentation for the React app will be organized here. The goal is to keep it practical and easy to follow for junior developers.

Planned sections:
- Folder structure
- State and data fetching
- Forms, validation, and error handling
- Pagination, search, and sorting
- UI patterns (toast, cards, responsive rules)
- Build and deploy with Docker
- Common problems and fixes
